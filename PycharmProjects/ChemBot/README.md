# Chem Bot

![Python ver](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8.2-orange)


**Chem Bot** This project is the product of my scientific research on the topic "Using programming in chemistry" dated 04/12/2024.

At the moment, he has been trained in 36 elements from the periodic table of Mendeleev from the 1st to the 36th inclusive

*```The bot was written through the aiogram library version 3.4.1 and asyncio library```*

## Usage ##

You can generate a token for tg-bot by [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

```python
TOKEN = 'WRITE YOUR BOT-TOKEN'
bot = Bot(TOKEN)
```
***before working with the bot, unzip the chem_elts zip file and paste the folder into the project!!!***
